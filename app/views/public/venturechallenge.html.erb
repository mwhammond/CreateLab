      <h2>What you get</h2>  
                 <p>
A unique opportunity to learn how to get your ideas or technology into the real world, prove that you can be innovative and get a chance to try entrepreneurship without compromising your studies. </p>
<br>
<p>On top of helping you work out a business around your idea or technology we will introduce you to some of the most exciting tech companies in London as mentors and set you up with time with some of the best service companies around to help you cover legal, designers, marketing etc and if you want to raise money we will help you learn how to get investors excited, finally there's co-working space and physical prototpying space plus £20,000 in case prizes (no equity taken) to help you build a prototype. 
<p>

  <h2>When?</h2>  

  <p>Beginning of February until the 20th March. Everything is tailored around your studies but we will expect you to make progress between workshops, this is about building something in the real world not remembering things for an exam. We suggest you set aside 10 hours per week; 3 hrs in evening workshops and the rest on Wednesday afternoon (or another evening if you can't make the group session). </p>


      <h2>Who we're looking for</h2>  

      <p>
         60 extremely smart, passionate and resiliant Imperial Students (undergrad, PhD, Postdoc and alumni up to 2 years out) who are either have outstanding technical skill or the business hustle to make things happen. This is <u>not</u> about business plans and forecasts, it's about making amazing technology that has an impact on the world. Teams can include non Imperial students but at least one person be studying at Imperial.</p>    
         <br>
         <p> 
         You can enter as individual or a team but you will need to form teams of 2 or more at the first masterclass. You will need either a cutting edge technology or an idea for a product or service, there's a <a href="http://www.sixmonthmba.com/2009/02/999ideas.html">huge list here</a> if you can't think of anything.</p>  




           <h2>What happens after?</h2> 

           <p> 
            Everything finishes in time for you to revise for the next block of exams if you are an undergrad. What you do with your proven business model and new skill set is up to you. We would love you to start-up when the time is right and have huge amounts of support if thats what you want to do, but you're just as welcome to nail that Google interview with tales of getting thousands of users for the thing you built.
           </p>
