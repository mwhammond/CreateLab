        <h3>Whether you want to make cool things or be a successful entrepreneur, the Create Lab can help you get the skills and meet the right people to make it happen. The year is split into 3 parts. In the first term there are lots of <%= link_to('events', events_path) %> to learn, get inspired, get ideas and meet great people. During the second term 20 teams will enter the <%= link_to('Venture Catalyst Challenge', venturechallenge_path)%> and get the chance to work with experts to turn their ideas into a viable business model and win a share of £20,000. Finally once you're ready we provide 1:1 help to get your business off the ground.<h3>
